# House Cup Quest Tracker
### Live Version: https://matthewbroyles.github.io/House-Cup-Quest-Tracker/
### Created this as a fun way to track my "quests" throughout the day/week
### Created a Mockup design for it.

### It turned out how I wanted it.

### I would be interested in adding more fun elements like an animation on the tasks that play when finishing (ie. a pixel person slaying a beast).
### Also adding some texture and depth to the background would be a next step.
### But for now I will be putting this down and moving onto the next project.
